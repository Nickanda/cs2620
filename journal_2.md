Ease of Development
Using gRPC makes the application easier.

Abstraction: gRPC abstracts low‑level socket management, message framing, and protocol parsing.
Strong Contract: The use of a .proto file enforces a clear API contract, reducing ambiguity and errors.
Built‑in Error Handling: Many networking concerns (timeouts, retries, etc.) are handled by the framework.
Data Size
Data Efficiency:

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (a binary format) which typically produces smaller payloads compared to text‑based or JSON protocols.
While there is some additional overhead for metadata, the overall message size is usually reduced.
Structural Changes
Client:

The client no longer manually opens sockets or parses space-separated strings.
Instead, it simply invokes methods on a generated stub and handles structured responses.
This leads to cleaner UI integration and more maintainable code.
Server:

The server’s focus shifts from low‑level I/O and protocol parsing to implementing business logic in well‑defined service methods.
The gRPC server framework handles connection management and message serialization automatically.
Testing
Improved Testability:

With clearly defined RPC methods, unit tests can easily mock the gRPC stubs and verify responses.
Integration tests become simpler by invoking RPC calls directly rather than simulating low‑level socket communication.
The strict API contract reduces ambiguity, which minimizes errors during both unit and end‑to‑end testing.

Does the use of this tool make the application easier or more difficult?
Easier. Using gRPC abstracts many of the low-level network and protocol-handling details. It enforces a strict API contract (via the .proto definitions), simplifies error handling, and provides built-in support for streaming and concurrency. While there is an initial learning curve (e.g., understanding Protocol Buffers and the gRPC framework), overall development and maintenance become simpler.

What does it do to the size of the data passed?
Efficiency in Data Size. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, which are a compact binary format. This typically results in smaller message sizes compared to verbose text-based protocols like JSON or your current space-separated strings, even with some additional overhead for message framing.

How does it change the structure of the client?
Client Structure Changes:

The client shifts from a manual socket connection loop to using a generated stub to make RPC calls.
UI components interact with the backend through well-defined methods rather than parsing raw text responses.
Error handling becomes more streamlined since gRPC returns status codes and exceptions that can be caught and managed in a uniform way.
How does it change the structure of the server?
Server Structure Changes:

The server implements service methods as defined in the .proto file, with the gRPC server handling connection management and request routing.
You no longer need to manage selectors, handle asynchronous socket I/O manually, or parse custom protocol strings.
This leads to a more modular design where business logic is separated from network concerns.
How does this change the testing of the application?
Testing Improvements:

Unit tests can mock the gRPC stubs and directly test the business logic without requiring actual network connections.
Integration tests are simplified by invoking RPC calls directly and verifying structured responses rather than parsing raw text.
The strong contract defined by the .proto file reduces ambiguity in what the server expects and returns, thereby reducing the scope for errors during testing.
